This time, I participated in a CTF held by DSO and NUS. This was the most challenging CTF I have ever participated in so far. Many of the challenges involved Reverse Engineering which I wasn't familiar with. However, I definitely learnt a lot from the CTF, especially in the areas of Mobile and Reverse Engineering! :)
