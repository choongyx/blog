Hello! I am a Computer Science student interested in Cybersecurity and I enjoy participating in CTFs to learn more about the field. In this blog, I will be posting my writeups to the CTFs I have participated in. I hope you will enjoy reading them and hopefully learn a thing or two! I'd love to have some feedback on my writeups as well and I am contactable via my [email](mailto:imma_potatooo@hotmail.com).
